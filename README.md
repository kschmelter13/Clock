# Clock
Program that outputs 2 clocks, one in 12 hour format and another in 24. You can add hours, minutes, or seconds to both clocks simultaneously.

Input numbers 1-4 to choose an option from the menu.

I think that I made the code in a very structured and readable way so that anyone can read and implement on it if needed.

I do think that I couldve included functionality for the clock to update every second which wouldve made it a lot more functional.

For me thinking through the logic of the clock was my favorite part becuase it was almost like a puzzle that I had to figure out in
order for the functionality of the clock to be correct.

I think one of the biggest things that I did in this project that would be transferrable is the way I maintained the code in classes.

I created a time class so that i could store the hours, minutes, and seconds.
